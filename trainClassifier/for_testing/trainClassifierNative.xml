             [trainedClassifier, validationAccuracy] = trainClassifier(trainingData)
             returns a trained classifier and its accuracy. This code recreates the
             classification model trained in Classification Learner app. Use the
             generated code to automate training the same model with new data, or to
             learn how to programmatically train models.
             Input:
             trainingData: a matrix with the same number of columns and data type
             as imported into the app.
             Output:
             trainedClassifier: a struct containing the trained classifier. The
             struct contains various fields with information about the trained
             classifier.
             trainedClassifier.predictFcn: a function to make predictions on new
             data.
             validationAccuracy: a double containing the accuracy in percent. In
             the app, the History list displays this overall accuracy score for
             each model.
             Use the code to train the model with new data. To retrain your
             classifier, call the function from the command line with your original
             data or new data as the input argument trainingData.
             For example, to retrain a classifier trained with the original data set
             T, enter:
             [trainedClassifier, validationAccuracy] = trainClassifier(T)
             To make predictions with the returned 'trainedClassifier' on new data T2,
             use
             yfit = trainedClassifier.predictFcn(T2)
             T2 must be a matrix containing only the predictor columns used for
